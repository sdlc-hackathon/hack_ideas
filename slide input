Close the gap by being a step ahead
'A book written by a neuroscientist Hillary Scarlett.. That book was about how our brains deal with change. It was primarily written about organisations change. In that book the author wrote:

"Our brains are helpless prediction machines. They are consciously and subconsciously trying to guess what is going to happen to us. They want to be able to predict and make sense of the world. This stems from the brain’s drive to protect us. If the brain can predict what is about to occur then it is in a better place to guard us and keep us out of harms way. Our brains like certainty and they are distracted when we don’t have certainty.’ This is why we have estimated time in airports, maps etc.
